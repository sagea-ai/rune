        Is Rune missing a feature that you'd like to see? Feel free to propose it here.

        Before you submit a feature:
        1. Search existing issues for similar features. If you find one, 👍 it rather than opening a new one.
        2. The Rune team will try to balance the varying needs of the community when prioritizing or rejecting new features. Not all features will be accepted. See [Contributing](https://github.com/openai/rune#contributing) for more details.
